                            India is home to the world&apos;s largest youth population, yet millions
                            of talented young individuals from financially challenged
                            backgrounds struggle to access quality education, skill training,
                            and emotional support.

                            A significant percentage of students from rural areas and urban
                            slums face barriers such as limited academic resources, lack of
                            mentorship, absence of career guidance, and financial
                            constraints. Many first-generation learners drop out due to socio-
                            economic pressures, weak learning foundations, and limited
                            exposure to opportunities.

                            To fulfil India&apos;s vision of becoming a global knowledge and skill
                            hub, it is essential to build an ecosystem where every youth —
                            irrespective of background — has the support, skills, and
                            opportunities to excel academically, personally, and
                            professionally.
